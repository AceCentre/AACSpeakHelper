## Some brief notes for Kurdish TTS


We are using the web system found at http://tts.kurdishspeech.com

- Maximum characters is 2000 characters per entry
- The Web endpoint can deal with latin characters or Arabic. You need to use the setting to allow latin characters if the text is in latin characters. It cant deal with mixed input
- Its typical for Kurdish speakers to use a latin (QWERTY - US English layoout) 
- You can have a Kurdish layout too - or use the language input of your computer to do the conversion

See [here](https://kurdishcentral.org/sorani-keyboard-layout/) for some details on the layout. 

Use [this tool](https://www.lexilogos.com/keyboard/kurdish_conversion.htm) to convert arabic to Latin characters
