# AAC Setup

See [the specific guides](aac-guides.md) for your AAC software but in short;

* Add a button to _copy_ the message bar (writing area)
* Then, have an action on this button to call the executable found at `%UserProfile%\AppData\Local\Programs\Ace Centre\TranslateAndTTS\` (**Note: You will need to browse for the app. You can paste this link into the file explorer but you need to find the exact path on your own computer)**
* Then it's wise to wait around 5-10 seconds (and if translating text)
* Clear the message bar
* Paste the returning text back if you are translating

You can test it by copying some text from a text file and running the app. Give it a go.
