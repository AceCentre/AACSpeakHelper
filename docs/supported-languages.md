_**WARNING**_

**Please note. If you use any online TTS system, the data is sent to a server and sent back. These services do not store this data, but it is up to you to check this and how it may work against your own IG policy. The app does have a feature of 'caching' data, too - but this is not sent to Ace or anyone else. It's all on the device.**
