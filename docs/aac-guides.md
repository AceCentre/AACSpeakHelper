### Specific notes on Kurdish TTS

We are using the web system found at http://tts.kurdishspeech.com

* Maximum characters is 2000 characters per entry
* The Web endpoint can deal with Latin characters or Arabic. You must use the setting to allow Latin characters if the text is in Latin. It can deal with mixed input
* It's typical for Kurdish speakers to use a Latin (QWERTY - US English layout)
* You can have a Kurdish layout, too - or use the language input of your computer to do the conversion

See [here](https://kurdishcentral.org/sorani-keyboard-layout/) for some details on the layout.

Use [this tool](https://www.lexilogos.com/keyboard/kurdish\_conversion.htm) to convert arabic to Latin characters

* You need to have the settings set for Latin or not
* It is wise to cache results. You may need to set your cache to 0 to clear the cache if there is audio that goes wrong
