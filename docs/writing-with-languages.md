# Writing with languages

So we are not providing here software Gridsets/Pagesets of Keyboards for different languages.&#x20;

If you want a client to write in the language of this TTS system (not use translate) You have to

* Find a keyboard layout the client is familar with in the correct **script**.

{% hint style="info" %}
This part is **KEY.** Many TTS systesm will not respond or act strangely if you present the wrong script (eg. latin script as in English, French, German when a TTS is needing arabic). You can get lucky but technically the system may be doing transliteration without you realising it
{% endhint %}

* Copy and paste the characters needed into a Gridset/Pageset that you need. Remember to not put spaces behind the characters&#x20;
* This is painstaking. Please consider sharing your work so others can benefit.&#x20;
